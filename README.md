# Elevvo Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains 4 Machine Learning projects completed as part of my **[Elevvo](https://elevvo.tech/) Internship**.  
Each task covers a different ML problem and demonstrates data processing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization skills.

### Tasks Overview
| Task | Description | Key Techniques / Models | Results / Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| [1.Student Score Prediction](https://github.com/Abdelwakil-Mansour/Elevvo-Internship-Tasks/tree/main/Task%201%3A%20Student%20Score%20Prediction#readme) | Predict students' exam scores based on study hours | Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression | Polynomial Regression: MAE 0.27, R² 0.99 |
| [2.Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Abdelwakil-Mansour/Elevvo-Internship-Tasks/tree/main/Task2_CustomerSegmentation#readme) | Cluster mall customers into segments based on demographics and spending | K-Means, Silhouette Score, Power BI dashboard | 5 clusters: Cautious Wealthy, Moderate, Luxury Spenders, Impulsive, Budget-Conscious |
| [3.Loan Approval Prediction](https://github.com/Abdelwakil-Mansour/Elevvo-Internship-Tasks/tree/main/Task3_LoanApprovalPrediction#readme) | Predict loan approval status | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Orange Data Mining workflow | Random Forest: 99.88% accuracy |
| [4.Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/Abdelwakil-Mansour/Elevvo-Internship-Tasks/tree/main/Task%204%3A%20Sales%20Forecasting%20Description#readme) | Forecast future Walmart sales | Regression (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost), ARIMA, Modified ARIMA, SARIMA | Forecasts visualized and compared with actual sales |

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

## 🔗 Notes
- Datasets are not included if large; links to Kaggle datasets are provided in each task README.  
- Each task folder contains: notebook(s), data (optional or sample), and any dashboards/workflows.  
- Task 4 is focused on **time series forecasting**, while other tasks cover regression, classification, and clustering.
